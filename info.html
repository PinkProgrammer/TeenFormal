	<h3>Dress Code</h3>
	<p>This event is intended to strengthen and encourage young Christians. We want to teach our young people to comply with dressing in a way that professes godliness. We do not want to put these young people in a situation that would cause any of them to be a stumbling block for each other based on the attire they are wearing. We are also intending that this is a formal event. Please follow these guidelines when choosing your attire for this event.</p>
	<h4>Young Ladies</h4>
	<p>Dresses cannot be backless, strapless, spaghetti straps or expose cleavage. Acceptable dresses are those below the knee or long formal dresses. No pants, please.</p>
